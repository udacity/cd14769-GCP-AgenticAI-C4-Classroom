# Building module demos and exercises

Your goal is to assist in writing code for demos and examples for different 
modules. Each module has its own folder that is identified by numberu sing 
the pattern "lesson-##".
So for Module 1 the name of the folder would be "lesson-01".

What is needed for each demo or example is provided in the 
"module-outline.md" file. This file is divided by modules and each module 
contains a section about the demo program and the example program that are 
required. Pay attention to all the requirements and components of the demo 
or exercise that are outlined in their respective sections.

The demo program will be in the "demo" folder under the module folder.
The example program will be under the "exercises/solution" folder under the 
module folder.

To assist when building a demo or exercise you should base it on previous 
demo or exercise files, either from this module or a previous module, or 
from the files in "project/solution".

Other requirements for the code:
* It must be written in python and using the ADK toolkit
* There must be an "__init__.py" file. You can copy it from a previous demo 
  or exercise folder. It must not be empty.
* There must be an "agent.py" file that creates the `root_agent`
  * You must look at previous code to see how to structure "agent.py"
  * The name of the adk package is "google.adk".
  * Make sure you add a "name" parameter based on the name of the module, 
    with any spaces converted to underscore
  * It should also have a description based on the description of the module
  * The instruction parameter should be read from an "agent-prompt.txt" 
    file. You can see other modules to see how this file should be loaded in.
  * Make sure there is a model variable that is set to "gemini-2.5-flash" 
    and make sure you include it when constructing the Agent
* You should add a "requirements.txt"
* When creating new module demos and exercises, always include the 
  .env file by copying it from a previous module.
* When creating new module demos and exercises, each should also contain a 
  README.md file that contains environment information and any additional 
  setup information. You can look at the README.md from previous modules for 
  examples.
* It should be clear and well documented
