# Building module demos and exercises

Your goal is to assist in writing code for demos and examples for different 
modules. Each module has its own folder that is identified by number using 
the pattern "lesson-##".
So for Module 1 the name of the folder would be "lesson-01".

What is needed for each demo or example is provided in the 
"module-outline.md" file. This file is divided by modules and each module 
contains a section about the demo program and the example program that are 
required. Pay attention to all the requirements and components of the demo 
or exercise that are outlined in their respective sections.

The demo program will be in the "demo" folder under the module folder.
The example program will be under the "exercises/solution" folder under the 
module folder.

To assist when building a demo or exercise you should base it on previous 
demo or exercise files, either from this module or a previous module, or 
from the files in "project/solution".

Other requirements for the code:
* It must be written in python and using the ADK toolkit
* There must be an "__init__.py" file. You can copy it from a previous demo 
  or exercise folder. It must not be empty.
* There must be an "agent.py" file that creates the `root_agent`
  * You must look at previous code to see how to structure "agent.py"
  * The name of the adk package is "google.adk".
  * Make sure you add a "name" parameter based on the name of the module, 
    with any spaces converted to underscore
  * It should also have a description based on the description of the module
  * The instruction parameter should be read from an "agent-prompt.txt" 
    file. You can see other modules to see how this file should be loaded in.
  * Make sure there is a model variable that is set to "gemini-2.5-flash" 
    and make sure you include it when constructing the Agent
* You should add a "requirements.txt" that contains the python modules that 
  are required and the version that we are currently using as the minimum 
  version.
* When creating new module demos and exercises, always include the 
  .env file by copying it from a previous module.
* When creating new module demos and exercises, each should also contain a 
  README.md file that contains environment information and any additional 
  setup information. You can look at the README.md from previous modules for 
  examples.
* It should be clear and well documented

# Reviewing demos and exercises

If asked to review an existing demo or starter, evaluate it based on
the following and suggest possible improvements:

* Review all the prompts in files named `*-prompt.txt`. Each should clearly 
  state what the role of the agent is, give clear scenarios how to handle 
  exceptional input and output, and generally steer it towards safe and 
  effective results.
* Review functions and tools to check if there is sufficient error handling.
* Make sure there is a `CLASSROOM-README.md` file. This should contain the 
  information outlined below and be detailed and thorough.
* Make sure there is a `.env-sample` file, created as described below.

# Building the exercise starter

You are an expert technical educator.
You will be helping create starter files that students should build upon.
These files will be in the "exercises/starter" directory and should be based 
on the files that are in "exercises/solution".
Information about the lesson being taught can be found in the 
"module-outline.md" file.

Guidelines:
- The starter files should contain boilerplate code, or other code that is
  incidental to the lesson being taught.
- You should only use code that is present in the solution files. You should 
  not create any new code.
- You should not edit the original solution in any way. Just produce the 
  files in the starter that can be used to create the solution.
- For parts of the files that the student will need to fill in, they should 
  be marked with a comment starting with "TODO:"
- You should create an ".env-sample" file based on the environment 
  information provided in the README.md file in the solution directory.
- The __init__.py file should be copied verbatim
- Prompt files should just have the contents "TODO"

# Generate "CLASSROOM-README.md" from Code Repository

You are an expert technical educator.
Analyze a code repository and generate a README based on the specified type.


## INPUT
- The lesson number
- README type: **demo**, **starter**, or **solution**
- You can get the topic / lesson focus based on the "module-outline.md" file

Based on the lesson number and the type, you will know the root directory of
the files you will be working with.
- For **demo** types, this will be "demo"
- For **starter** types, this will be "exercises/starter"
- For **solution** types, this will be "exercises/solution"

## README TYPES

### Type 1: DEMO README
**Purpose**: Explain and describe existing code walkthrough
**Tone**: Descriptive - "This code does...", "Here's how it works..."

### Type 2: STARTER README
**Purpose**: Give instructions for learners to implement
**Tone**: Instructional - "Build a...", "Implement...", "Your task is..."

### Type 3: SOLUTION README
**Purpose**: Explain and describe the solution code
**Tone**: Descriptive - "The solution works by...", "This implementation..."

{Partial code with TODO comments}


# TODO: {Instruction for what to implement}


# TODO: {Instruction for what to implement}
```


### Expected Behavior


{Describe what the completed implementation should do}

**Running the agent:**

You will run the agent using the `adk web` tool. This tool launches a chat
environment that lets you test the agent interactively and examine the
internal processing that ADK and Gemini go through.

The `adk web` application is meant to be run from a directory that has a
collection of agents, which is usually the parent directory from where your
agent's code is. Typically, you will run this on the same machine where your
browser is located with a command such as:

```bash
adk web
```

{Provide any other information about starting it that are needed}

**Example usage:**
```
{How to run/test the code}
```


**Expected output:**
```
{What correct implementation produces}

## GUIDELINES


- Extract actual code from the repository - do not invent examples
- For demo/solution: Explain what the code does and why it works
- For starter: Give clear instructions on what to build, not how to build it
- Use code blocks with inline comments
- Keep explanations concise (3-5 sentences per section)
- Include expected output examples
- Use the term "customer" when talking about the person who is using the agent

# Building a "video-outline.md"

You are an expert technical educator.
Based on the code for either a module demo or exercise solution, the 
information about a module in the "module-outline.md" file, and the contents 
of the "CLASSROOM-README.md" file for the demo or exercise, you will create 
an outline that will be used to present the demo or solution.

Guidelines:
- This outline will be used by the instructor to create a walk-through of 
  the code and then running and testing the code.
  - For the demo, the instructor will be introducing the concepts that this 
    module is intended to teach and that the code is intended to illustrate. 
    It should be making concepts clear as they are walking through the code. 
  - For the exercise solution walk-through, the code will already be written,
    so the instructor is going over the code, not talking about what needs 
    doing.
- Focus on the new elements that are being introduced and taught
- Each presentation should be about 5 minutes spoken
- The outline will be guidance for the instructor, not a script
- The outline should be presented sequentially, so the instructor can go 
  linearly from point to point.
  - The code should be presented in a top-down format, introducing the main 
    `root_agent` first and then seeing how those parts are broken down.
- Be specific - mention specific files, functions, commands, and prompts. 
  Remember that the instructor will be following this to make their 
  presentation.

Format:
- Produce a list of bullet points of the major things to highlight
- Be specific 
  - mention specific files, functions, and line numbers
  - give specific commands to run or prompts to try to illustrate
  - when covering setup, give specific steps to follow
- Each bullet point should be about one line long
- If there are additional things to mention related to the major point, use 
  an indented sub-list under the bullet
- The title will include the name of the project directory (either "cd14768" 
  or "cd14769")

## Output structure

# {project directory} - Lesson {module number} - {"demo" or "exercise"}
{name of lesson}

- {objective of the lesson}
