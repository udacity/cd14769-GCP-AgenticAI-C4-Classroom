# Module 05 Demo

## Environment

GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<your project ID>
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1

Make sure you replace <your project ID> with the ID for your project.

Using a LOCATION of us-central1 is usually the best bet in the United States,
but consider other cloud data center locations for elsewhere.

## Additional Setup

### Agent Engine Session

To create an Agent Engine instance:

1. Make sure you have the .env file setup as above.
2. In the same directory as the .env file, run the `create_agent_engine.py`
   script that is in the `notes` folder.
3. It will print out the resource name, which we'll be using to start the
   server.

If you forget the resource name, you can visit the Google Cloud Console and
go to the Agent Engine configuration page (Hint: Search for it) to get the
resource name.

Start `adk web` to use the session with something like this:
```bash
adk web --session_service_uri agentengine://resource/name/goes/here
```
